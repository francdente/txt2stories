## 📦 Data

The `data/` folder contains:

- `public_interview/`: Publicly released dataset used in our experiments.
- `public_system_desc/` : Publicly released dataset used in our experiments.
- `generated_US/`: Synthetic user stories generated using a large language model (LLM) for **15 non-public datasets**. The original datasets are not shareable due to privacy restrictions.

## 🔬 Experiments

The `eval/` folder replicates all experiments from **Section 6** of the paper, including:

1. **Ablation Studies**:
   - Four ablation experiments to test the contribution of individual components.

2. **Pairwise Alignment Quality**:
   - Evaluates how well our method aligns user stories with elicitation interview chunks.

3. **Correctness and Completeness**:
   - Measures how accurately and thoroughly the generated stories represent the elicitation interview.

4. **Efficiency of the Blocking Operator**:
   - Benchmarks the runtime and scaling behavior of our blocking mechanism.
