Speaker 2: Um, do you want to keep this flow of, uh, work, like planning, uh, in the future system? So still make an appointment right after the, uh, current appointment. Uh, just making sure that everything is planned immediately. Uh, or do you want to switch over to a more remote planning system that they do it from home? Uh, because. 
00:17:41 Speaker 3: And at least have the opportunity to, to have a remote system that the patient can log in and make their own appointments and, uh, based based on the information that. So it's easily changed, even if you have, like a premade appointment.";1
"As a patient, I want to look at the appointment information, so that I know what the next appointment is going to entail.";"00:16:30
Speaker 1: Um, yeah, I think because since we sort of envision for the future, like this intelligent planning system that, um, yeah, it depends on how quick it would work. But maybe since you also mentioned that we value, like, the patient's control over their own appointments and stuff and that they are very informed. So maybe a more remote system would be better since, uh, that way if they have had an appointment, uh, just all their information can just be put into the system if there's any new findings or whatever, maybe some x rays or whatever takes some takes take longer to process. And then maybe the patients afterwards get get an email like, okay, um, based on this, uh, you're, you're recommended to have an appointment for, for example, a dental hygienist or whatever in like six months or in four months or in two months or, so, maybe. Yeah. To have them. Better have them be better informed. It might be better if it's just an email, because then they can just sit down and take the time to read. Okay. What has the system, like, come up with for me and. Yeah.
00:21:18 Speaker 3: I think it's the, the the scheduling and the information that you get from the from the system, like, uh, the, the predictions of, uh, what you need for procedures and what it's going to cost and, uh, um, maybe even some advice on insurance that you maybe need to step it up to the.";1
