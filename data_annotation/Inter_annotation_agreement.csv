"As a patient, I want to be able to make appointments in case of an emergency, so that can always come by quickly.","Speaker 3: Yeah. Yeah. And as always, it's just a recommendation, right? So it's always up to the patient to to pick a date and a time that's available. Yeah. And then make the appointment. So it's then it's always like the, uh, an appointment that is suited for the patients.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 3: Okay.",0,0,0
"As a patient, I want to be able to make appointments in case of an emergency, so that can always come by quickly.","Speaker 3: And at least have the opportunity to, to have a remote system that the patient can log in and make their own appointments and, uh, based based on the information that. So it's easily changed, even if you have, like a premade appointment.
Speaker 1: And I also think, uh, an important part of that slight time lag that is there is that, uh, a dentist should always if like, the system would be fully automatic at some point. A dentist should always be able to intervene. So if a system says like, oh, this person only has to have their next appointment in like two years or something, somehow, you never know. Some parameters are weird and this is some spits out something strange that the dentist actually sees that and it's like, well, wait a minute, let's not do that. And so yeah, that might actually yeah, might, might be a better idea.
Speaker 2: So more something like they, they get a notification or an email like the day after they had an appointment with information about okay. So we did this, um, we noticed this. So for future appointments this might be the best.",0,0,0
"As a patient, I want to be able to make appointments in case of an emergency, so that can always come by quickly.","Speaker 3: So it's it's wrong. It needs to be fixed. Yeah.
Speaker 4: And so that's, uh.
Speaker 2: Because the patient also gets any control in this situation. So they make the appointments and then they can see it in the app. Um, can they change it then, or, uh, can I change the appointment since it's a more specialized appointment instead of just say, checkup?",0,0,0
"As a patient, I want to be able to make appointments in case of an emergency, so that can always come by quickly.","Speaker 1: Financial reasons or. Yeah, mom's died.
Speaker 4: Yeah. But, um.
Speaker 1: I also think maybe in the case of, like, a dentist making such a direct, uh, appointment, it's usually because of urgency. So maybe, um, in the database, each appointment should maybe have, like, a, like an attribute. Urgency. Yes. Just a boolean. Urgent, true or false, and maybe urgent appointments. Then if a patient, uh, were to try to move that one, they might get maybe an extra pop up, like, hey, this is an urgent, uh, uh, appointment. Are you sure about this? Yeah, maybe something like that.",1,1,1
"As a patient, I want to be able to make appointments in case of an emergency, so that can always come by quickly.","Speaker 2: Um.
Speaker 3: Yeah. Uh, uh, so, uh, we started out with, uh, yeah, centering the appointments and making sure that everything that needs to be connected to the appointments is connected to the appointment. So a patient is able to set the appointment, um, and the appointment belongs to a dentist. So the patient makes an appointment with a dentist. Um, and the appointment should be based on a recommendation. So, uh, right now, this means that, um, a patient is only able to make an appointment based on a recommendation. Uh, I feel like the way we, uh. Yeah. How we landed on the last meeting, this was kind of the way to go. Um, does the patient also need to be able to set an appointment without a recommendation?
Speaker 4: Um, yeah, I think the option should be there. Um, for. Of course, if you suddenly have, like, tooth aches or something, you just want to be able to call and say, hey, my tooth is, uh, messed up, so I need some help or. Yeah, I think there's always cases where the you have to go, like around the recommendation system.",1,1,0
"As a patient, I want detailed information about the recommended procedure, so that I know what is going to happen in the next appointment.","Speaker 3: Yeah. Yeah. And as always, it's just a recommendation, right? So it's always up to the patient to to pick a date and a time that's available. Yeah. And then make the appointment. So it's then it's always like the, uh, an appointment that is suited for the patients.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 3: Okay.",0,0,0
"As a patient, I want detailed information about the recommended procedure, so that I know what is going to happen in the next appointment.","Speaker 4: Yeah. And then you also don't need to get a recommendation about that appointment. Uh. Because now the after the procedure, then you update the system and then it spits out a new recommendation. But that is not necessary if you have like an appointment next week and, uh, then you don't need the recommendation for, uh, you, uh, should get an appointment next week. Uh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because we've already talked about it face to face. Of course. Yeah.",0,0,0
"As a patient, I want detailed information about the recommended procedure, so that I know what is going to happen in the next appointment.","Speaker 3: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um, so going a bit back to the recommendations themselves. Um. We didn't know. Um, so, uh, specifically, what does the recommendation say? What are the points that need to be in the recommendation? So, um, I guess the date. So when does the appointment need to be made? Uh, but more than that, uh, what do they get to see.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Good question. Um, yeah, I feel like. So. Yeah. Firstly, when and I think maybe not a specific date, but more like, okay, in this area of time, maybe, maybe you could say, okay, go in November or whatever. Maybe a week or two weeks or some window that that makes sense. Um, of course, what the appointment is like. So this week for either dental hygienist or regular checkup or for taking X-rays or I'm not sure. So whatever it is. Um, and then, um, yeah, patients can just book their own specific time slots and I think then, um, yeah, sort of maybe not in the email then, but sort of like very small, maybe in 2 or 3 bullet points, like the explainability of the system. Like, okay, well, maybe just a y just y, okay. Because this and that or something.",1,0,0
"As a patient, I want detailed information about the recommended procedure, so that I know what is going to happen in the next appointment.","Speaker 3: Level. To the next level. Yeah.
Speaker 4: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I think also in terms of the like the control from the patient side and like the, um, I think the explainability of the system would also be very important. So kind of from an explainable recommender system angle okay. You get recommended this option. But why. You know, so I guess if this the automatic part of the system would like come up with a recommendation. The patient should have to see maybe the few aspects that we have waiting the most to that. So for example, okay, you have to have digital dental hygienist appointments because of I don't know, you've had to had, uh, this amount of plaque removal two times in a row. Yeah, something like that. So, uh, and then also as you mentioned, probably the financial pros and cons of it maybe. So sort of a cost analysis. Okay. Uh, you get recommended this, but, uh, it probably saves you this much money because you avoid this procedure by doing this right now, instead of leaving this and only coming in another half year and then seeing that there's bigger problems. So. Yeah.",1,1,0
"As a patient, I want detailed information about the recommended procedure, so that I know what is going to happen in the next appointment.","Speaker 4: Maybe you can get why it doesn't work. And then the system could use that information.
Speaker 2: Or just also like how far in advance, uh, the system needs to give the recommendation, because right now, uh, in my experience, I always get like an email, like two months in advance because the dentist is always booked, like completely full. And I can only make an appointment in like two months if it's not check up. Um, so I don't know if it's if the situation is the same in your practices, but, um. But, um, if so, then the system needs to make like, the recommendations, like, way in advance to make sure that there are actually spaces available. Because if you also need, uh, if you also need to keep, uh, like slots open for like the emergency, uh, uh, uh, appointments, those take also longer. So you need like big open slots for emergencies. So there aren't actually that many slots open for normal appointments. So how far in advance do the appointments also need to, uh, be recommended?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think basically as we discussed, kind of all the way at the start, sort of as early as possible, because of course you have, um, just a state of the database with all like the historical data and the dental data. And then, um, a patient comes in and then there's some stuff happening, some stuff being found out, then that is used to update the state of the database, and then in that the whole period following that, it's just stagnant that the database doesn't change. So right then the recommendation can already be made. So as we said before, maybe just the day after they could get an email to just do it as early as possible, I think that might be most efficient.",0,0,0
"As an employee, I want new recommendations to be generated when I update the dental records, so that the patients can always create new appointments when new information is added to the system.","Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Like we said, you'll never suddenly recommend something if, like, the database hasn't changed. So you just look every time, every time someone has come to the dentist. Because then the data has changed. And then you can make a new recommendation and then, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Because we, um, made an entity like, called appointments info. So, uh, we imagine this as like the notes or the updates the dentist makes for the dental records. Um, so dental records are like the general information about every patient. So the records get updated, and then a new recommendation gets made based on those new updated records. So if the records don't get updated, then no recommendation should be made, is what you're saying? No.",1,1,1

"As an employee, I want new recommendations to be generated when I update the dental records, so that the patients can always create new appointments when new information is added to the system.","Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah, but I do think what you mentioned might actually be a nice failsafe. So. Yeah. So of course, in the new system, the dentist also would still look at a patient's dental record during the procedures and stuff. So like it's being done now so they can still look on their screen and see, oh yeah, you have this tooth and whatever. So maybe it would be nice to also then have like that information up there as well. Uh, yeah. Could be an extra failsafe to make sure everyone stays nice and healthy.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Because I can imagine that, um, a system recommending procedures, it's cool. And it might, uh, improve things, but, uh, knowing medical institutions, uh, a lot can change when the procedure is actually happening. Uh, so building in some field saves might be smart. Yeah. So the recommendation should not be like the one and holy entity that decides everything. It's like what it says. Like it's a recommendation, not. Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. That's a really good point.",0,0,0
"As an employee, I want new recommendations to be generated when I update the dental records, so that the patients can always create new appointments when new information is added to the system.","Speaker 2: Okay. Uh, so, uh, right now, when someone, uh, is done with their appointment, um, they leave the dentist and they go to the front desk to make a new appointment. Uh, in this case, do they already have, like, a recommendation from the dentist, or is it just completely up to the patient to make. And, uh.
Speaker 1: Do you mean in the as a situation? Yeah. So right now it's either just the standard or you just go for the checkup every six months? Yeah, unless during your checkup, the dentist either sees you have a cavity and it's like, oh, we have to do something, or they see like, oh, you really have this amount of plaque. So you should now make an appointment with the dental hygienist or something. So it could be like a direct recommendation that just the dentist tells you during the checkup. Yeah. Yeah, that sometimes happens. And if that isn't there, then it will just be like the standard six month period, basically.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Because I'm thinking that the system would help people to stay more healthy. And it's just weird to just leave some people out who don't want to use technology. So I thought maybe there would be a way to still include them in the system, but I think it's just too hard because then that would break the whole workflow. Yeah, yeah.",0,0,0
"As an employee, I want new recommendations to be generated when I update the dental records, so that the patients can always create new appointments when new information is added to the system.","Speaker 2: Yeah, because I'm thinking a recommendation is not a sure thing. It's determined by an algorithm. And when a dentist makes an appointment, uh, the dentist has already looked at it itself. So they know that the procedure that is planned is the actual procedure that's being carried out.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I think there could definitely be a distinction in, uh, like what we talked about last time where like, do you recommend the system makes like recommendations. And at the end of the day, the dentist could just check them real quick and just see, like, okay, this or none of this is like extremely weird. And then they just check it. But if they have made the appointment themselves, then of course they don't have to go back and check their own work. Yeah. Um, so yeah, I guess it could be tagged by made by dentist or something or whatever, and then it can already bypass that. Um, yeah. I think other than that, it would basically just work the same in the system. It will just be made as an appointment and it will have the same stuff inside, I guess.
Speaker 4: Yeah. And then you also don't need to get a recommendation about that appointment. Uh. Because now the after the procedure, then you update the system and then it spits out a new recommendation. But that is not necessary if you have like an appointment next week and, uh, then you don't need the recommendation for, uh, you, uh, should get an appointment next week. Uh.",1,0,0
"As a patient, I want to be able to decline the recommendations, so that I can make an appointment for when I see fit.","Speaker 3: Yeah. Yeah. And as always, it's just a recommendation, right? So it's always up to the patient to to pick a date and a time that's available. Yeah. And then make the appointment. So it's then it's always like the, uh, an appointment that is suited for the patients.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 3: Okay.",1,1,1
"As a patient, I want to be able to decline the recommendations, so that I can make an appointment for when I see fit.","Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 4: I guess I was also thinking what if, uh, like the recommendation now are based on what the doctor thinks, but and, uh, it's historical data and stuff, but what if the patient have restrictions themselves? So let's say in August, in July I'm going to be on vacation for two months. So how does the how would you then deal with that? That's a good restriction. It'd be like, okay, for those two months, I don't want to be recommended anything because I'm not there.
Speaker 1: Um, maybe. Although I don't from like a user perspective, I don't think if I'm going to do that or if I'm just subscribed to a dentist office, then I'm going to tell them, hey, I'm on vacation then, so don't recommend me. So I think maybe if you get a recommendation, um, maybe within because you should always be able to, even for every recommendation, you get to just reschedule. Although I do feel like maybe if you get a recommendation, it should always be like in a certain window, I guess because you it won't work if you get a recommendation for, um, the 22nd of October at 9:00, because then people are like, well, I can do 10:00, but not nine, you know? So I think maybe if you, for example, get recommended, okay, go to the dental hygienist in two months that it gives you like an a window of like of like a week. And then you can choose and maybe, um, there should then be like a button like, hey, this window doesn't work for me or something. And then. I feel like. It's just all my stuff sliding off. Um, I feel like. Yeah. What do you think? I think if you say this window doesn't work for me, should you?",1,1,1
"As a patient, I want to be able to decline the recommendations, so that I can make an appointment for when I see fit.","Speaker 3: Okay.

Firstly, when and I think maybe not a specific date, but more like, okay, in this area of time, maybe, maybe you could say, okay, go in November or whatever. Maybe a week or two weeks or some window that that makes sense. Um, of course, what the appointment is like. So this week for either dental hygienist or regular checkup or for taking X-rays or I'm not sure. So whatever it is. Um, and then, um, yeah, patients can just book their own specific time slots and I think then, um, yeah, sort of maybe not in the email then, but sort of like very small, maybe in 2 or 3 bullet points, like the explainability of the system. Like, okay, well, maybe just a y just y, okay. Because this and that or something.",0,0,0

Speaker 2: Yeah. Because then you also do away with the problem of like vacations and those kind of things, because most times you are, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe. And I think if you are on vacation that day. Yeah. And you choose like, hey, um, I can't make these dates then maybe depending on the recommendation, um, it should automatically say like, okay, do it either earlier or later. Like if you get recommended to go in like 12 months or so or something because there's nothing at all wrong with you and they're like, oh, you're totally healthy and we don't need to see you basically ever. They could just say, okay, if you then say, oh, this one doesn't work, then it might say, okay, um, just do something that's a little later or do something that's a little earlier, like if you have like some big problem maybe coming up according to the studio system, it has to be prevented. Then it might say, okay, if you can't make this period, then do it earlier. Because I could also understand if people don't want to give like, um, a window in which they're not available because also, um, like taking into account potential data breaches or whatever. Um, I know people I feel like people don't like, um, telling everyone when they're on vacation and just telling your dentist.

Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that would make sense. So, um, I think that doesn't really matter for the system itself, but in more of a workflow, um, kind of angle for the dentist, maybe it makes sense to reserve like the last 20 minutes of each day for them to just go over all the recommendations of the systems for all the patients that that dentist saw that day. And then they could just say, check, check. Because I think normally it just looks normal because the it just says, okay, uh, dental hygienist in four months and the dentist like, oh yeah, it sure makes sense. And yeah, because they can only pick out the ones that look really weird or. Yeah.

"As an employee, I want to be able to quickly note down what happened in the appointments, so that administering patient data does not take too long.","Speaker 1: No. Yeah.

I feel like that's how it would go.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Okay. Um. All right. Um, so then, um, yeah, we are almost at, uh, 45 minutes, so we'll just ask one more question and then we finish off, um, so, um, reminders. Uh, last time we talked about it, uh, you told us that it would be fine to just have one reminder, uh, when you set the appointment, and then it's the responsibility of the patient to make sure that they're there. Um, is this still the case? Uh, do you still want just one reminder and then, uh, just hope to see them there and then. Or do you want a final reminder, like one week in advance, just To be sure.
Speaker 1: Um. Yeah, well, I guess it wouldn't be a bad thing to have, like, a reminder a week in advance.",0,0,0

"As an employee, I want to access previous schedules, so that I can track my hours.","Speaker 3: Well, currently those, um, shifts can be, uh, read from like, one year ago. Um, so it's saved for a pretty long time. Uh, I don't know the exact, uh, exact dates, but if I, I was on vacation for three weeks and, um, some, uh, shift, uh, and I need to read all of the shift clerks from the past three weeks. Um, it's still possible.
Speaker 2: Uh, yeah. So it's not saved, like, forever, but it's it's like, at least for, uh, maybe a couple months. Necessary?
Speaker 3: Yes, indeed.",1,1,1
"As an employee, I want to access previous schedules, so that I can track my hours.","Speaker 3: Yeah. Indeed.
Speaker 1: And what about a full day or a half day? For example, if someone works, um, eight hours, can he or she also requests, like, a half day off, or is that not possible?
Speaker 3: Yeah. That's, um, when someone wants to fill in the dates, he can also, um, currently says which hours? Uh, they want to, um, have the day off so they can click on having a full day or just specific hours of that day.",0,0,0
"As an employee, I want to access previous schedules, so that I can track my hours.","Speaker 3: Well, currently it's just one textbox, so okay, you can enter whatever you want. Um, but the way, um, um, in the, in the future, what we would like to see is that the manager can, um, give a sequence of, uh, like, things that happen that they, um. And so the manager can change the, um, what is stated in the shift clerk.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. Uh, okay. Person has some questions.
Speaker 2: Uh, yeah. So regarding the the those shift that logs, um, artists, like, saved, um, forever or just or these, like, saved, uh, for, like, uh, maximum, maximum amount of weeks. And then after like two weeks, those, um, those laws get deleted or something or archived.",1,0,0
"As an employee, I want to access previous schedules, so that I can track my hours.","Speaker 3: Um, well, in the, uh, for the shift packing in the application that we currently have, um, which was not, um, that good, um, was like, uh, the same way as you see, uh, the schedule for your own, um, uh, shifts. You also have another separate schedule for all of the open shifts. Uh, that can be, um, given to some employee. Um, so they can just simply click on that shift they want to have where they, um, where it's always the case that, um, it is in their own store and they I can see the time scheduled for that shift. Um, and just, uh, send the request of, um, getting that shift.
Speaker 1: Okay. And that needs to be approved by the manager.
Speaker 3: Indeed. Yeah.",0,0,0
"As an employee, I want to access previous schedules, so that I can track my hours.","Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 3: Yeah, yeah. And also, the time should be, um, um, um, clear to see when you have those shifts. So those two, um, are the primary, um, highlights in the schedule.
Speaker 2: Okay. Uh, yeah. Thank you for the clear information. Um, Person, do you have anything, any other questions to add on this topic?",0,0,0
"As an employee, I want to have an overview of events, so that I do not miss these events","Speaker 3: Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: Okay. And, um, what are the activities, events, occurrences that take place, um, during the handover of shifts? Like, is there a certain, uh, you know, like, uh, sequence you have to fill in this first or this first or that first, or is it just, you know.
Speaker 3: Well, currently it's just one textbox, so okay, you can enter whatever you want.

"As an employee, I want to have an overview of events, so that I do not miss these events","Speaker 1: No, no. Go ahead.
Speaker 3: Oh. Uh, and maybe Person can, um, say something more specifically in the scheduling of employees. Um, how that has been done.
Speaker 4: Uh, yes. They're, um, scheduled, um, weekly. Um, so they receive their schedule in an app. Um, names? Uh, go. And, uh, w may go. Um, w I don't know how to speak to letter. Um, but there is an app where they can view their schedule. Um, and this actually works nicely. They can just see their schedule and know about it. Um, it's more the problem that there are many different systems. And um, for example, WhatsApp they use for private. So it's not convenient for them to have it for work as well. Uh, because yeah, they often do it as a side job and they want to keep clear of it when they're just living your life. Um. Then for me, um, the big problems for are received. Um, the handover shifts, uh, is also different that over time actually doesn't allow them to create a messenger app. Uh, so WhatsApp doesn't have to be used anymore, but it just was too slow. It didn't work. Well, Um, so we went back to WhatsApp. Um, meetings are also, um, it depends per location. Uh, if they are monthly or weekly or. Yeah, there's not really a pattern there. It's based on availability of the employees and, uh, how often it is wanted to schedule. Um, um, but this also uses data, uh, for it, which is yet another system. Um, and these meetings don't show up in their calendar so often the day of the meeting reminders. And but then a lot of people have already different appointments. Uh, so there are some problems there. Um. I might have forgotten something in this, uh, overview. If you have questions, please ask.",1,1,0

"As an employee, I want to have an overview of events, so that I do not miss these events","Speaker 3: Um, what are could also be included is, um, like, having meetings, um, like work related meetings that are scheduled. So, for example, when a meeting is scheduled on Friday, um, it is also presented in the go may um, um application or part of the system. Um, like, uh, having a shift, of course, is, uh, included and.
Speaker 4: Maybe the ability to share the information from a shift. Um, for example, when requesting replacements, they can don't have to type all of it out. They can just share or this is a shift around replacement for. Can you cover it?

"As a shift leader, I want to add employees to a group chat, so that they can participate.","Speaker 1: Mhm.
Speaker 4: Um, does I miss something, Person?
Speaker 3: Um, well, what you should, uh, see is, um, from which, um, shop the employee is from. So, um. Okay, the location of the shop, uh, they are from, um.

Um, what other features should not be, um, accessible to employees and which should only be accessible to, um, to managers?

Speaker 2: Uh, great. Because you're already, uh, answered in the, uh, directly. You want the questions that I wanted to ask? Um, I have one. Yeah, one last question. Um, so we wanted to design a new messaging system instead of using WhatsApp. Uh, but this doesn't really necessarily eliminate the problem for, uh, of people using it for private life, uh, as well. Uh, it's the same with WhatsApp. If you have, like, a new messenger app. Uh, people can just contact. Um, how do you say that? Uh, our other colleagues, they're good friends with. We're just like, uh, some chit chat. You know, um, it's. This is like a problem. Or do you, do you just trust the employees to keep it, like, um, business wise professional.",1,1,0
