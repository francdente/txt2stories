Here are some examples of valid user stories:
As a customer, I want to reset my password online, so that I can regain access without calling support
As a project manager, I want to view a dashboard of team progress, so that I can monitor deadlines
As a student, I want to download lecture slides, so that I can study offline

Write a complete set of user stories deduced from the following interview transcript:
<specification>
Return all distinct user stories needed to cover the requirements in the transcript, with no overlap. Generate **at most** 50 user stories.

Output rules:
Only return the stories separated by newline.
Use the standard format: “As a <type of user>, I want to <goal>, so that <reason>”.
Output rules:
One user story per line.
No bullet points, numbering, markdown or commmentary-**only** the stories.
