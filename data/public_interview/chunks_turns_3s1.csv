int1,0,"Spk 0: we're doing I'm *** and this is **** we are colleagues and uh we are here for the IFA system and all the requirements that we'll now be discussing with you so that we can deliver a good system to you. Yeah. Um Uh just just can you give us 10 seconds? We just need to start recording because. Okay. Okay. So yes. Now the video and our conversation is getting recorded. All right. So we understand that IFA's new system wants to have some key features. For example, you need a proper budget, budgetting portal, reporting portal, scheduling portal and a fan portal for your consumers, fans, users. So we'll go one by one, uh and we'll ask you some questions regarding each of these key categories and then um maybe you can add whatever we have missed and we'll just round it up nicely. So uh regarding the budget, uh We want to know the basics first. So uh how is the IFA Financed and what are your main expense categories? You would say
Spk 1: Expense category. So the budget consists of income and expenses, of course. Uh And this can be our first kind, it can be an income from uh ticket selling for a specific game. It can be income income due to uh uh selling of a certain player. It can be an income to you to a sale of specific property. So it's such as a small stadium that the team may have. And things like this is the income outcome could be uh for example, salaries for players for the various stakeholders, various players, various roles within the team itself. A b um uh maintenance expenses for the study and things like that. Did that answers your question?
Spk 2: Okay, so the IFA is like an association of different teams and then the budget is consolidated uh through the IFA and then it's distributed to the teams? They're just trying to understand how.",3,1
