Spk 1: Expense category. So the budget consists of income and expenses, of course. Uh And this can be our first kind, it can be an income from uh ticket selling for a specific game. It can be income income due to uh uh selling of a certain player. It can be an income to you to a sale of specific property. So it's such as a small stadium that the team may have.

Spk 0: Okay, so first, very first the urgent one is the scheduling and then the budgeting and then uh okay. Um there was another line in documentation which said that officials of the IFA should be involved in the system? I have, the officials will have a role to play. Oh,
Spk 2: I don't think uh maybe it's paraphrasing a little. Let's let me find the exact line.",,0
4493,1231,33,"As the IFA, I want to be able to input different rulesets for different competitions, so that no mistakes will be made in updating leaderboards, scheduling matches or auditing budgets.","Spk 1: Okay. So in my view, the currently this is done also manually. The administer calls the referee. Can you uh can you participate in that game? And that's how the scheduling is happening and the enforcement of this policy, again, it's done manually. So for uh for the referee as well, the system should be uh should have some kind of uh guidance of how to allocate referees to games. For example, we wouldn't like the same refereee to participate in the game and two games of the same teams. Okay. Okay. Uh this yeah, for another example is that we would like to all referees to participate in the same number of games.
Spk 2: Okay,
Spk 1: So I would like the system to be able to uh facilitate the definition of such policy and then based on that policy to assign the referee to the games, it might be also that the system will enable the referees to install their preferences. Okay. For example, since I planned already my vacation for the next year, I cannot participate in these days. So when scheduling it will take these constraints as well.",,0

The automatic scheduling and override by the IFA representative. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah just one level.
Spk 2: Okay. And and this level of the IFA Scheduler is uh you need approval from two of them. A second reviewer. In case of change.
Spk 1: The same role, they are colleagues, but different people. Okay. They play the same role but in the specific case they uh played the role of initiator and an approver.",,0

Yeah. Um Uh just just can you give us 10 seconds? We just need to start recording because. Okay. Okay. So yes. Now the video and our conversation is getting recorded. All right. So we understand that IFA's new system wants to have some key features. For example, you need a proper budget, budgetting portal, reporting portal, scheduling portal and a fan portal for your consumers, fans, users. So we'll go one by one, uh and we'll ask you some questions regarding each of these key categories and then um maybe you can add whatever we have missed and we'll just round it up nicely. So uh regarding the budget, uh We want to know the basics first. So uh how is the IFA Financed and what are your main expense categories? You would say
Spk 1: Expense category. So the budget consists of income and expenses, of course. Uh And this can be our first kind, it can be an income from uh ticket selling for a specific game. It can be income income due to uh uh selling of a certain player. It can be an income to you to a sale of specific property. So it's such as a small stadium that the team may have. And things like this is the income outcome could be uh for example, salaries for players for the various stakeholders, various players, various roles within the team itself. A b um uh maintenance expenses for the study and things like that. Did that answers your question?
Spk 2: Okay, so the IFA is like an association of different teams and then the budget is consolidated uh through the IFA and then it's distributed to the teams? They're just trying to understand how.",,0
4621,3145,85,"As the IFA, I want to bring different existing systems together, so that I can avoid having to save redundant data.","Spk 1: Yeah that's a good idea. Uh We didn't talk about it but it might be some feature maybe in a future version. Yeah.
Spk 2: Okay. Um What what what level of involvement involvement do you expect your in house IT Team to have in the system and what level of and what do you want to outsource or or delegate to other campaigns?
Spk 1: So basically the IFA is not a software company. We were moving like uh to a uh to develop a maintenance system. So what we are looking for is a kind of outsourcing the entire development and maintenance. The communication between the software development and the IFA will be tasked through the information there IT Department. But the idea is that the uh IT department will out of the activity and the real development and we were essentially as the client for the company.",,0

I assume that the teams, for example, and uh on the IFA administrative would work with computers in kind of a web based application. The referee and the fans will probably have the app uh mobile applications so they can work with more easily.
Spk 0: Okay, so there will be like two separate systems. One is the very official one for the budgeting and reporting purposes, and the other one will be a fan, fan, fan with the fun things. I would say
Spk 1: I would I want to say the same system, but it may have different interfaces. Okay. Certainly the upper layer of the presentation, there will be different uh of course with access with different tactical culture to the various stakeholders, but the goal of the system is the same with a unified system.",,1

Uh This is the fun side of the players. But then do the players need to have a have an interface within the budgeting interface where they can see their salaries or something? No. No. Right.
Spk 1: No. This is the responsibility of the team, administration. The manager. The owner.
Spk 2: Yeah. Okay. I know we don't have details were in the preliminary phase but any any ideas about the timeline of the implementation, how things will move from the existing system to the new system.

4627,111,3,"As the IFA, I want to bring different existing systems together, so that I can avoid having to save redundant data.","Spk 1: No no no no no no. Okay. So the idea is that each team manage its own budget. The IFA only controls the ballance and monitor it to see that everything is managed properly. The responsibility for managing the budget is on the team, not only IFA.
Spk 0: Sorry, sorry to interrupt.
Spk 1: The IFA is only is making audits maybe set some regulation rules to what is the policies. So it it should have the ability to specify policy, budget policy in the system. So the system can alert of certain violation.",,0

Spk 0: Okay uh Yes. Uh Okay. We understand now what the requirements are with the reporting and the budget section. Uh Moving on to scheduling. Uh How do you schedule the matches now? Like how often do you plan a tournament? And how do you schedule the matches between teams?
Spk 1: Okay. So currently for each uh league in each season season meaning year, uh, there is a manual scheduling once a year. Okay. It's done manually, uh, maybe without taking into um consideration many constraints. Okay. Uh, so what I would like the system to have, is to have the ability to define policy of how to schedule games. For example, a common policy is that each game, it's uh, a pair of teams they too can sale, once in the in team A stadium and once in team B stadium, this is a common practice. So there was a need to determine the this kind of policy. Maybe we'll like to have a minimal uh, time between matches among the same pair. Uh, maybe it would like to say, uh set the date for uh, the day in the week in which the competition will take place, and many other things that regarding that policy.
